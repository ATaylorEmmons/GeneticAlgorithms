* Knapsack.py: Solves the knapsack problem. I worked through this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhT56blfRpE&t=275s&ab_channel=KieCodes  
* NonLinDio.py: Solves the Non linear Diophantine equation a*x + b*y = c - x*y. 
  - Any solution set to this equation (I believe) can be used to find factors for the integer a*b + c. This (is probably) proved by completing the square.
